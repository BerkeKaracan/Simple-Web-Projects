# 🚀 100 Mini Web Projects (HTML / CSS / JS)

A personal repository dedicated to mastering frontend fundamentals through hands-on practice. This collection contains simple, focused web projects built using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to build muscle memory for UI/UX implementation, responsive design, and CSS layouts (Flexbox/Grid) by writing code from scratch.

- Avoid copy-pasting; write every single line manually.
- Understand CSS Flexbox, Grid, and Responsive design.
- Grasp basic DOM manipulation and animations using JavaScript.
